# trackcovid-hackON

This is a covid and vaccine availability tracker website which is made by me and my team mate    ![Sumeet Yadav](https://github.com/Sumeet16), for a hackathon (HackON 2.0).

## Languages and Libraries we used:
1.) HTML5 <br>
2.) CSS3 <br>
3.) JavaScript  <br>
4.) Chart.JS  <br>

## How to use:
1.) Search for a city and then hit enter, and the website will fetch the data for you. <br  >
2.) User will see a state wise covid report of active cases on the left side of the screen. <br>
3.) User will be able to plot a line graph for max 31 days, of active, recovered and deceased patients. <br>
4.) When user click on vaccine slots, he/she will be redirected to another page where he/she can input the state and the city from the drop down and select date to check the availability and then click on search to fetch the results. <br>
5.) Every time you want to fetch a city, you need to refresh the page. <br>
